# Welcome to my Car Logos learning game!
The project idea was inspired by a six years old boy who loves cars.



## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals
The primary Project Goal is to create a simple car logos learning game that is suitable for young children.

The target audience are young children who are interested to learn car brand logos.


### User Stories

* As a young player aged between 6 - 8 years old, I want:
* The ability to view a short introduction so I can understand what the game is about.
* The ability to easily navigate throughout the site.
* Any text to be clear and consise so I can easily read and follow the instructions. 
* Feedback when I select an answer letting me know if I selected correct answer.
* The ability to track my score after every answer.
* Feedback at the end of the game so that I know what my overall score is.



### Design choices

* Colour Scheme
  * The color scheme comprises of shade of blue, gray and cream. I find that these colours complement each other.
  * The blue background works well for silver car logo images.
  * Orange color adds an element of vibrancy and fun to the site.


* Typography
  * Chilanka font was chosen for its playful style.
